    <h1>Mental Wellness: A Guide to Taking Care of Your Mental Health</h1>
    <p>Mental health is just as important as physical health. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and is essential for overall well-being. Taking care of your mental health can improve your quality of life, boost resilience, and help you navigate life’s challenges more effectively. Here’s a guide to maintaining mental wellness with tips, resources, and strategies.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Practice Mindfulness</h2>
    <p>Mindfulness is the practice of being present in the moment and accepting it without judgment. It can reduce stress, improve concentration, and boost your mood. You can incorporate mindfulness into your daily routine by simply focusing on your breath for a few minutes or practicing meditation.</p>

    <h2>2. Build a Support System</h2>
    <p>Having a support system can make a huge difference in managing your mental health.
