    <h2>5. Warm Up and Cool Down</h2>

    <h2>6. Stay Hydrated</h2>

    <h2>7. Fuel Your Body</h2>
    <p>Nutrition plays a significant role in your fitness progress. <br>Eat a balanced diet with a mix of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats to fuel your workouts and aid in recovery. If you’re looking to lose weight, monitor your calorie intake and adjust your diet accordingly.</p>

    <h2>8. Get Enough Rest</h2>
    <p>Rest is as important as exercise. Your muscles need time to recover and repair after workouts. Make sure to get enough sleep each night, and consider taking rest days to allow your body to recharge.</p>

    <h2>9. Track Your Progress</h2>
    <p>Tracking your fitness progress is a great way to stay motivated. Use a fitness app or journal to log your workouts, nutrition, and achievements.  <br>This helps you see how far you’ve come and motivates you to keep pushing forward.</p>

    <h2>10. Listen to Your Body</h2>
    <p>Pay attention to how your body feels during and after workouts. If you experience pain or discomfort, it’s important to rest and seek medical advice if necessary. <br>Don’t push through pain, as this can lead to injury.</p>
